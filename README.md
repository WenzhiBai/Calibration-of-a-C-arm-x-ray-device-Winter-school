Authors: Shuai Zhang



2. Prerequisites
We have tested the code in Ubuntu 18.04, but it should be easy to compile in other platforms.

OpenCV
We use OpenCV to manipulate images and features. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: http://opencv.org. Required 3.2.0.

3. Building DefSLAM library and examples
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/zsustc/Calibration-of-a-C-arm-x-ray-device-Winter-school.git
Execute:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. 
make

This will create the executables x_ray_calibration and x_ray_calibration in the current folder.

4. Datasets
The original images captured from the C-arm device can be found in the folder "original_images_uncropped", the size is 1280*1024;
The cropped images can be found in the folder "uncalibrated", the size is 1024*1024.
You should use the cropped images since the original images contain extra border illustrating some patient related information.
